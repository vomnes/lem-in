# lem-in
Elementary algorithmic project - Graph Traversal - This project is meant to make you code an ant farm manager.
The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
It's a graph traversal problem, i use the breadth-first search algorithm implemented with adjacency lists (linked list).

## Usage
```
./lem-in [-details] < [map_name]
```

## Input data

The program receive the data describing the ant farm from the standard output in the following format:
```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
```

-The rooms, which are defined by: name coord_x coord_y.
-The links, which are defined by: name1-name2
-All of it is broken by comments, which start with #
-Lines that start with ## are commands modifying the properties of the line that comes right after.
